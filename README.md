Dear Admissions Committee,

I am writing to recommend Haoyu Wu for admission to the Computer Science program at UNC. I had the pleasure of having Haoyu as a student and later as a teaching assistant in my course, _Introduction to Computer Systems_ (CSAPP).

Haoyu is an exceptionally curious and motivated individual. Despite being a cross-disciplinary student in my class, he demonstrated remarkable dedication and enthusiasm from the very beginning. He consistently completed assignments and labs to a high standard, showcasing his strong programming skills and scientific thinking. This course provided him with a solid foundation in both technical and analytical aspects of computer science.

This year, Haoyu has taken on the role of a teaching assistant for the same course. He has shown a genuine passion for helping students overcome challenges and has received positive feedback from his peers. His ability to mentor and support others reflects his strong communication skills and commitment to the field.

In summary, I firmly believe that Haoyu is a highly qualified candidate for your Ph.D. program. His academic excellence, curiosity, and dedication make him an ideal fit for advanced studies in computer science. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,
